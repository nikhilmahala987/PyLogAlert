# PyLogAlert üõ°Ô∏è

![PyLogAlert Demo](pylogalert-demo.gif)

**PyLogAlert** is a lightweight, real-time log analysis and alerting engine written in Python.  
It monitors log files for suspicious patterns, parses them into a structured format, and sends **rich, interactive notifications** to Slack.

This project serves as a functional example of a **‚ÄúMini-SIEM‚Äù** focused on the core principles of **detection and notification**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üîç **Real-time Log Monitoring** ‚Äì Processes log entries as soon as they‚Äôre written.
    
- üß© **Pattern-Based Detection** ‚Äì Regex-powered parsing for syslog-style logs.
    
- üèóÔ∏è **Modular Architecture** ‚Äì Separation of concerns: _Collect ‚Üí Parse ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Respond_.
    
- üì° **Rich Slack Alerts** ‚Äì Interactive notifications with buttons (e.g., ‚ÄúCheck IP on VirusTotal‚Äù).
    
- üîí **Secure by Design** ‚Äì API keys/webhooks stored in configs (excluded from Git).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Each log entry follows a simple but powerful pipeline:

**Collect ‚Üí Parse ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Notify**

1. **Collect** ‚Äì Tails a specified log file.
    
2. **Parse** ‚Äì Converts raw log strings into structured dictionaries.
    
3. **Analyze** ‚Äì Matches structured data against detection rules.
    
4. **Notify** ‚Äì Executes a playbook and sends an alert to Slack.
